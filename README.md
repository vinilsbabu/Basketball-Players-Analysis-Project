Basketball Players Analysis Project
Introduction
This project involves the analysis of a dataset containing information about basketball players, including their names, teams, numbers, positions, ages, heights, weights, colleges, and salaries. The goal is to preprocess the data, perform various analyses, visualize the results, and derive meaningful insights.

Preprocessing Steps
Initial Data Inspection
Examined the dataset to understand its structure, including the number of columns, data types, and presence of missing values.
The initial dataset has the following columns: Name, Team, Number, Position, Age, Height, Weight, College, Salary, AgeGroup, Age_Group.
Missing Values Check
Determined the non-null count for each column:

Column	Non-Null Count	Dtype
Name	458	object
Team	458	object
Number	458	int64
Position	458	object
Age	458	int64
Height	458	int32
Weight	458	int64
College	374	object
Salary	447	float64
AgeGroup	456	category
Age_Group	456	category
Statistical Summary of Numerical Columns
Computed mean, standard deviation, quartiles, and other statistics for numerical columns:

Number	Age	Height	Weight	Salary

Null Values Check
Identified columns with missing values, focusing on 'College' and 'Salary'.
Duplicate Values Check
Ensured there were no duplicate rows in the dataset.
Data Correction
Corrected the 'Height' column by replacing its values with random numbers between 150 and 180 to ensure data consistency.
