# Basketball Players Analysis Project
## Introduction
This project involves the analysis of a dataset containing information about basketball players, including their names, teams, numbers, positions, ages, heights, weights, colleges, and salaries. The goal is to preprocess the data, perform various analyses, visualize the results, and derive meaningful insights.

## Preprocessing Steps
### Initial Data Inspection
Examined the dataset to understand its structure, including the number of columns, data types, and presence of missing values.
The initial dataset has the following columns: Name, Team, Number, Position, Age, Height, Weight, College, Salary, AgeGroup, Age_Group.
### Missing Values Check
Determined the non-null count for each column.
### Null Values Check
Identified columns with missing values, focusing on 'College' and 'Salary'.
### Duplicate Values Check
Ensured there were no duplicate rows in the dataset.
### Data Correction
Corrected the 'Height' column by replacing its values with random numbers between 150 and 180 to ensure data consistency.
### Basic Summary of Numeric Columns
Computed mean, standard deviation, quartiles, and other statistics for numerical columns.
## Data Insights
### Salary Distribution
The histogram of the salary range of employees reveals a left-skewed distribution, indicating that most employees earn lower salaries, with a few employees earning significantly higher salaries, thus creating a long tail on the right side.
### Team Analysis
New Orleans Pelicans boast the largest player count, suggesting a robust roster with depth and versatility, potentially enhancing strategic options during games. In contrast, Orlando Magic has the fewest players, indicating either a streamlined team focused on key talents or potential challenges in recruiting. Team size disparities may influence gameplay dynamics, rotation strategies, and overall competitiveness within the league, highlighting the significance of roster management and recruitment strategies in professional basketball franchises.
### Percentage Split Relative to the Total Number of Employees
In the context of the total employee count, New Orleans Pelicans constitute 4.15%, indicating a substantial presence within the league's talent pool. This percentage reflects the team's significance and potentially its competitive strength. Conversely, the Minnesota Timberwolves represent 3.06%, indicating a slightly smaller share of the overall workforce. Despite being slightly lower, this percentage still signifies a notable presence in the league. Such percentage splits offer insights into team distribution and competitive balance, influencing league dynamics and strategies for both teams in professional basketball.
### Position Distribution
In basketball, each position has distinct roles. Point guards (92 players) lead offense, emphasizing playmaking. Shooting guards (102 players) focus on scoring, often from long-range. Power forwards (100 players) excel in rebounding and inside scoring. Small forwards (85 players) combine scoring and defensive versatility. Centers (79 players) anchor defense and excel in rebounding and rim protection. The distribution of players across positions reflects teams' strategic needs and player strengths, influencing game tactics and lineup formations. Teams aim for a balanced roster composition to maximize on-court performance and adaptability in various game situations.
### Age Group Distribution
The age group distribution among players reveals significant representation in the 20-29 range, with 334 players. This indicates a predominant demographic of younger, potentially more agile and energetic athletes. The 30-39 range, with 119 players, reflects a smaller but still notable cohort of experienced players, likely contributing leadership and seasoned skills. With only 3 players aged 40-49, there's a sharp decline in representation, indicating rarity in players continuing their careers at an older age. Such insights highlight the diversity in player demographics and the varying contributions they bring to the sport across different age brackets.
### Salary Expenditure
The Cleveland Cavaliers have the highest salary expenditure, indicating significant investment in player salaries, potentially reflecting their commitment to assembling a competitive roster. Additionally, the center position (C) commands the highest salary expenditure, suggesting teams prioritize investing in dominant players for pivotal roles like rebounding, defense, and scoring in the paint. Such expenditure trends reflect strategic priorities in allocating financial resources to secure top talent and build a formidable team, essential for competitiveness and success in professional basketball leagues.
### Correlation Analysis
The correlation analysis between age and salary yields a coefficient of 0.214. This positive correlation suggests a weak but discernible relationship between age and salary among basketball players. While not strongly correlated, it implies that, on average, older players tend to command slightly higher salaries. Factors such as experience, skill level, and market demand likely contribute to this association. Understanding this correlation helps teams and players gauge salary expectations and career trajectories, aiding contract negotiations and roster planning strategies in professional basketball environments.
## Conclusion
In conclusion, the analysis of the basketball players dataset offers valuable insights into various aspects of the sport, from player demographics to team dynamics and financial investments. Preprocessing steps ensured data integrity, while subsequent analyses unveiled compelling patterns and correlations. The distribution of salaries highlights disparities within the league, with most players earning modest incomes and a select few commanding substantial salaries. Team analysis sheds light on roster composition, with implications for strategic gameplay and competitive balance. Position and age group distributions underscore the diverse skill sets and contributions players bring to the court, informing team-building strategies. Moreover, the correlation between age and salary suggests nuanced dynamics in player compensation, reflecting factors like experience and market demand. Overall, this project equips stakeholders with actionable insights for roster management, recruitment strategies, and financial planning, crucial for success in the dynamic landscape of professional basketball.
